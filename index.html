                    <p>My name is Sankara. I am 21 years old and have been tutoring maths for roughly four years.</p>
                    <p>I believe that maths can be a lot of fun and that it can also be totally defeating and boring. I have had the privilege and handicap of some great teachers and some terrible ones. I do my best to channel all the best teachong qualities that I have experienced but most of all I take full advantage of the opportunity to tailor lessons and concepts to the individual student and their needs.</p>
                    <p>I am a respectul, tolerant and organized person. I am the oldest of two siblings. While my sister is a lovely person now, her years of terror taught me to be very patient.</p>
                    <p>My interests outside of tutoring include basketball, coding, drawing (doodling, to be more accurate) and awkward comedy TV shows.</p>
